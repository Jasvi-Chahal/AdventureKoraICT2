                There are only two spots for a bungee jump, the more popular one being the Last resort. The resort rests a few kilometers away from all the city amidst terraced slopes and lush forests. In such location, one gets to enjoy peace and solitude amidst the natural beauty.
                The jump is the most exhilarating for a  few minutes. Once when you stand at the edge of a bridge above one of the deepest gorges of the Bhotekoshi River.
               You jump from an elevation of 3600 ft to experience a 100 m free-fall which is one of the highest natural jumps in 160 m deep gorge.
                 Wait! Do not panic! You will jump with the friendly instructors and the safety equipment and procedures. Although you get a nerve-wracking experience, it is safe.
                The other Bungy Jumping is available in the Pokhara.</p></div>

            If you want to break the monotony of your life, paragliding gives you this out-of-this-world experience. You see the beautiful topography of Nepal while gliding so far above.
            Giving a new twist to this old flight is Parahawking. There you fly parallel to the magnificent falcons. Parahawking involves feeding the Falcons while in the air by putting pieces of meat in your hand. And then following the birds on their flight. This is one unique, fun and adventurous thing to do in Nepal.</p></div>
