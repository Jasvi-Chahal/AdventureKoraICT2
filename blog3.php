        <p>Annapurna Base Camp is considered to be a moderate trekking route. Compared to other trekking routes in the Himalayas, ABC trek has a lot of accommodation and tea-houses along the way for you to choose from.

Here are the things you need to think off before making deciding to trek

What kind of travel style is available?

The first thing you need to decide before trekking is what kind of trek do you want to go for? 
Annapurna Base Camp trek is a popular trekking destination, so you have a lot of options. You can either opt for a trekking house trek travel style.

In this trek style, you will have a guide and accommodation.

The next one is  GAP- Guide Accommodation and Porter and all meals.  

You can easily order meals at the accommodation you are staying at.
 In major trekking points such as Chommorong, you can opt to eat out at some of the local eateries too. But the higher you go up the mountains, you have fewer and fewer tea-houses.

When is the best time to travel?

 January, February, March, April, May, September, October, November, December

But one thing we need to remember is that the climate keeps changing in the mountain. Over the years, monsoon winds that come from the Bay of Bengal have been changing. 

However, Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done in most of the year.

March-April is Spring in Nepal, so the weather is clear. The walk through the forested paths is especially beautiful as you’ll get to see rhododendrons in full bloom and mostly green vegetation. It tends to get a bit windy later in the day with showers. The higher you go up in the mountain, the colder it gets and you’ll even have snow.

Mid-June and July are monsoons and it’s not advisable to trek. However, you can opt to trek to Mardi Himal, a lesser-known trekking route in the Annapurna region. You might not see the mountains, but the wildlife and forest are especially beautiful.

September marks the best season for trekking. With a clear sky and pleasant weather. You’ll see a lot more trekkers on the trails than before. December onwards, winter season sets in. Trekking is only recommended for those who are fully prepared. You have to be extra careful about changing weather conditions then.



When September rolls around, the clouds leave their hold of the sky creating a perfect backdrop of clear and blue skies. The mountains wake up from their deep slumber during Monsoon season and display their full bloom of beauty. This makes for a perfect trekking season up until November albeit a bit crowded.

By December, winter is in full swing with occasional heavy snow. Since there are a lot fewer people and more wildlife, it is a perfect time to trek for the prepared. However, caution must be exercised to its fullest to prepare completely for the winter weather of the Himalayas.</p>
